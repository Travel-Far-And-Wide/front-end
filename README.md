# front-end
## Expected Tech Stack for Front End: 
### - React
### - Redux
### - Component Library (Material UI?)


## User Experience
- A `user` can visit site and see `photos` laid out in a grid

- A `user` can create, read, update, and delete `stories` and `photos`.

- A 'user' can tag photos to a specific location on a map (google maps API)

- Build an image uploader into the site to allow users the ability to upload their own assets. (This will require some work with a package called Drop Zone and a service called Cloudinary).
